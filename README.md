## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Database connection and frontend was big challenge, also teammates that have dropped out of hackathon without advanced notice unabled me to choose the topic right away and had to wait for unresponsive former teammates that have left, lack of division of work was a huge burden.

Another challenging part was to recognize where to put the code in.
